2. Put Pedigrad.py and your main file in location Y;
3. Include the following line to your main file:

from Pedigrad import *

4. Update the paths in Pedigrad.py as follows:

* Change ```'Pedigrad_py/PartitionCategory/'``` to ```'path/to/X/Pedigrad_py/PartitionCategory/'```

* Change ```'Pedigrad_py/PedigradCategory/'``` to ```'path/to/X/Pedigrad_py/PedigradCategory/'```
